# X Article Publisher Skill

[English](README.md) | [中文](README_CN.md)

> Publish Markdown articles to X (Twitter) Articles with one command. Say goodbye to tedious rich text editing.

**v1.1.0** — Now with block-index positioning for precise image placement

---

## The Problem

If you're used to writing in Markdown, publishing to X Articles is a **painful process**:

| Pain Point | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Format Loss** | Copy from Markdown editor → Paste to X → All formatting gone |
| **Manual Formatting** | Set each H2, bold, link manually — 15-20 min per article |
| **Tedious Image Upload** | 5 clicks per image: Add media → Media → Add photo → Select → Wait |
| **Position Errors** | Hard to remember where each image should go |

### Time Comparison

| Task | Manual | With This Skill |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| Format conversion | 15-20 min | 0 (automatic) |
| Cover image | 1-2 min | 10 sec |
| 5 content images | 5-10 min | 1 min |
| **Total** | **20-30 min** | **2-3 min** |

**10x efficiency improvement**

## The Solution

This skill automates the entire publishing workflow:

```
Markdown File
     ↓ Python parsing
Structured Data (title, images with block_index, HTML)
     ↓ Playwright MCP
X Articles Editor (browser automation)
     ↓
Draft Saved (never auto-publishes)
```

### Key Features

- **Rich Text Paste**: Convert Markdown to HTML, paste via clipboard — all formatting preserved
- **Block-Index Positioning** (v1.1): Precise image placement using element indices, not text matching
- **Reverse Insertion**: Insert images from highest to lowest index to avoid position shifts
- **Smart Wait Strategy**: Conditions return immediately when met, no wasted wait time
- **Safe by Design**: Only saves as draft, never publishes automatically

---

## What's New in v1.1.0

| Feature | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Image positioning | Text matching (fragile) | Block index (precise) |
| Insertion order | Sequential | Reverse (high→low) |
| Wait behavior | Fixed delay | Immediate return on condition |

### Why Block-Index?

Previously, images were positioned by matching surrounding text — this failed when:
- Multiple paragraphs had similar content
- Text was too short to be unique

Now, each image has a `block_index` indicating exactly which block element it follows. This is deterministic and reliable.

## FAQ

**Q: Why Premium Plus?**
A: X Articles is exclusive to Premium Plus subscribers.

**Q: Windows/Linux support?**
A: Currently macOS only. PRs welcome for cross-platform clipboard support.

**Q: Image upload failed?**
A: Check: valid path, supported format (jpg/png/gif/webp), stable network.

**Q: Can I publish to multiple accounts?**
A: Not automatically. Switch accounts in browser manually before running.

**Q: Why insert images in reverse order?**
A: Each inserted image shifts subsequent block indices. Inserting from highest to lowest ensures earlier indices remain valid.

**Q: What if text matching was used before?**
A: v1.1 replaces text matching with `block_index`. The `after_text` field is kept for debugging but not used for positioning.

**Q: Why does wait return immediately sometimes?**
A: `browser_wait_for textGone="..."` returns as soon as the text disappears. The `time` parameter is just a maximum, not a fixed delay.
